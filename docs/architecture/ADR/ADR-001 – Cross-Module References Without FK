## ADR-001 – Cross-Module References Without FK

## Status
Accepted

## Decision
Cross-module relationships are implemented using ID references only.
No physical FK constraints across schemas.

## Rationale
Preserves module autonomy and prevents lifecycle coupling.

## Consequences
Integrity is enforced in Application Layer.
